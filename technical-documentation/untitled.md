# Development Setup

## Local Setup {#local-setup}

1. Install [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/) for your OS. Also install Fabric via `pip install fabric`
2. Create .env file with the reference of`.env.example`or receive .env file from your team member.
3. Run`fab up`
4. Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8082/](http://127.0.0.1:8082/) to see the frontend / polymer running. The Django app is running under

   ​[http://127.0.0.1:8082/api/](http://127.0.0.1:8082/api/)​

5. Login to backend using `fab ssh:backed`and create admin with `python manage.py createsuperuser`
6. Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8082/api/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8082/api/admin/) login with your credentials.
7. Important! User created with superuser command will not be connected to any country, so frontend will fail. You need to assign country manually in admin panel from user edit page.
8.  And can now go to ​http://127.0.0.1:8082/tpm/ to see the frontend interface.
