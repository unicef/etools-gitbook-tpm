### tpm.tpmpartners app

To store the global data that is related to TPM,  nested application named `tpmpartners` was implemented.  
Views and serializers are still located in the parent application to keep the consistant place for all module logic.

The App consists of the following parts:  
- `migrations` - database migrations  
- `models.py` - partner with their staff members  
- `synchronizer.py` - VISION partner synchronizer  
- `tasks.py` - periodic tasks, which are responsible for keeping the partners synced with the VISION
